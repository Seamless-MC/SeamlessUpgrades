  Messages and how to use them   
  
   Generic-Edited is the broadest statement possible when a players upgrade is modified  
   
   Now if you want to get more specific you can add more messages to each message by simply adding the upgrade name with -Edited, -Added, or -Removed  
   
   Ex. Keep_Inventory-Edited: 'message' or Keep_Inventory-Removed: 'message'  
   
   Official names available in data.yml  
   
  Generic-Edited: '&8[&6&l&oSeamless&r&8]&r &8You now have {AMOUNT} {UPGRADE}s'  
  
  Keep_Inventory-Added: '&8[&6&l&oSeamless&r&8]&r &8You have received a keep inventory credit, you now have {AMOUNT}'  
  
  Keep_Inventory-Removed: '&8[&6&l&oSeamless&r&8]&r &8You have {AMOUNT} keep inventory credits remaining.'  
  
  Keep_Exp-Added: '&8[&6&l&oSeamless&r&8]&r &8You have received a keep experience credit, you now have {AMOUNT}'  
  
  Keep_Exp-Removed: '&8[&6&l&oSeamless&r&8]&r &8You have {AMOUNT} keep experience credits remaining.'
